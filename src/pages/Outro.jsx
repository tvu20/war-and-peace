          Why does a story live on in the collective consciousness of its
          receivers long after the last words on the page have been read? If the

          upon creating their work, it is art.

          It is through our ability to be infected by the art we consume that
          allows deep emotional experiences to be transmitted throughout decades
          and centuries. We as humans may have progressed over time, but our
          emotions and capacity to feel remain the same.
